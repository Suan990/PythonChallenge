# PythonChallenge
In this challenge I was tasked with creating two python scripts, one to analyze the financial records of a company and another to analyze election results for a small town. I extracted two csv files: budget_data.csv and election_data.csv for this project.

In the first challenge PyBank, I wrote a python script to get the following values: the greteast increase in profits, greatest decrease in profits, net amount of Profit/Losses, total months in dataset and changes in Profit/Losses for the data given over the entire time period. I am attaching the copy of my results for the first task:PyBank. Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 6 19 58 PM
